This is a web app for tracking drones which cross into the NDZ-zone, potentially harming the nesting of Monadikuikka. Drones persist only in the frontend, not on server.

Made with React in the frontend and node.js and express in the backend. Hosted on Render: https://reaktor-birdnest-assignment.onrender.com/
